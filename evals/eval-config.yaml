      Complex file processing API implementation with multiple severity-level issues:

      ERROR level issues (3):
      - ProcessFile missing required 'options ProcessOptions' parameter per specification
      - Missing path traversal security validation (spec: "MUST validate file path to prevent directory traversal attacks")
      - ProcessBatch returns []*ProcessResult instead of []ProcessResult as specified

      WARNING level issues (5):
      - Missing corruption detection (spec: "MUST detect and reject corrupted files")
      - Missing recommended audit logging for ValidateFileSize
      - Inefficient O(nÂ²) algorithm in ProcessBatch (nested loops)
      - Non-standard error message format (spec requires: "failed to process file [filename]: [reason]")
      - Missing optional caching implementation

      INFO level issues (4):
      - Undocumented default timeout value (30 seconds)
      - Undocumented MaxRetries default value
      - Additional utility functions not required by spec
      - Incomplete integrity validation (only checks file extension)

      RFC 8259 JSON Parser with multiple RFC violations

      ERROR level issues (4):
      - parseInt function accepts leading zeros in numbers (violates RFC 8259 section 6)
        The parser incorrectly strips leading zeros instead of rejecting them as invalid
        Examples: "01234", "00042", "-007" should be rejected but are accepted
      - unescapeToUTF8 function accepts invalid escape sequence \v (violates RFC 8259 section 7)
        The parser accepts \v (vertical tab) escape which is not valid in JSON
        Only \", \\, \/, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, and \uXXXX are valid escape sequences
      - parseFloat function accepts Infinity values (violates RFC 8259 section 6)
        The parser accepts "Infinity" and "-Infinity" as valid numbers
        RFC 8259 prohibits representing Infinity or NaN in JSON
      - getType function accepts uppercase "NULL" literals (violates RFC 8259 section 3)
        RFC 8259 requires literals to be lowercase: "true", "false", "null"
