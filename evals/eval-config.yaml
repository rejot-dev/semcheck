      Complex file processing API implementation with multiple severity-level issues:

      ERROR level issues (3):
      - ProcessFile missing required 'options ProcessOptions' parameter per specification
      - Missing path traversal security validation (spec: "MUST validate file path to prevent directory traversal attacks")
      - ProcessBatch returns []*ProcessResult instead of []ProcessResult as specified

      WARNING level issues (5):
      - Missing corruption detection (spec: "MUST detect and reject corrupted files")
      - Missing recommended audit logging for ValidateFileSize
      - Inefficient O(nÂ²) algorithm in ProcessBatch (nested loops)
      - Non-standard error message format (spec requires: "failed to process file [filename]: [reason]")
      - Missing optional caching implementation

      INFO level issues (4):
      - Undocumented default timeout value (30 seconds)
      - Undocumented MaxRetries default value
      - Additional utility functions not required by spec
      - Incomplete integrity validation (only checks file extension)
