  <p>
    Semcheck is a tool that helps you write better code by providing feedback on your code's
    correctness and style. It does this by using large language models (LLMs) to analyze your code
    and provide feedback on your code's correctness and style. Semcheck is designed to be used in a
    variety of contexts, including pre-commit hooks, continuous integration, and continuous
    delivery.
